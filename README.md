# Artificially Generated Financial Crypto Datasets

This python notebook provides instructions for artificially created datasets with the objective to closely resemble actual crypto-currency data from financial apps and/or digital wallets. We assume that a hypothetical company has decided to rollout one or more modules in its  app and is trying to understand the impact of these new modules on the users, transaction frequency, transaction amount, complications with new modules, etc.

Several real financial datasets were used as inspiration for this project in order to understand the schema, data range, data types, and underlying patterns of users and transactions.

This notebook offers step by step instructions and extensive guidance for the reasoning behind every data modelling decision.
